Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) package which allows the app to have a structured collection of data.It is a relational database management system that is based on structured query language (SQL).
- The backend is implemented using Java along with Springboot Framework, which is an open-source micro framework that has become a major player in the backend enterprise Java ecosystem.
- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
